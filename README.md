# PHPAY

Come to the PHP side ðŸš€ ðŸŒ‘

The main goal of **phpay** is to set patterns to be easily implemented on PHP projects for payment Gateway. We want to make easy to quick start a PHP ambient with the basic resources need. Check out the patterns we defined this document bellow.

## Startup

Step by step to get this up and running

### Clone repo and go to project folder

```
git clone https://github.com/stanleygomes/phpay.git && cd phpay
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### Great vscode extension

We recomend use of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client) extension.

### Start server

Copy enviroment variables template

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Via docker-compose (start database, run migrations and start server)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Access container via terminal

```
docker container exec -it phpay-webserver /bin/bash
```

To test it on the browser, simply go to: `http://localhost:8000/welcome`

## Git flow

To file a new a feature

- create a branch from `master` branch. Use the pattern: `feature/description`
- file a pull request on `master` branch
- since your PR is aproved, it will be merged to `master` branch
- in a moment in time we'll create a release, using the pattern: `release/vX.X.X`
