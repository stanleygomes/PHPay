# PHPAY

An open PHP store platform. Focused in small businesses ðŸ’° ðŸ›’

The main goal of **phpay** is to set patterns to be easily implemented on a web store. We want to make easy to quick start a PHP ambient with the basic resources every store need. Check out the patterns we defined this document bellow.

## Startup

Step by step to get this up and running

### Clone repo and go to project folder

```
git clone https://github.com/stanleygomes/phpay.git && cd phpay
```

### Start via docker compose

First, copy enviroment variables for your application

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Then, start containers (this command will start database and run migrations)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Verify if the containers are up and running

```bash
docker container ls
```

Now, access the webserver container

```
docker container exec -it phpay-webserver /bin/bash
```

At this point, your are connected to webserver container. Install composer dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

After this step is finished, you can exit the container:

```bash
exit
```

Since you are back to your terminal, you may need to change some folder permissions

```bash
sudo chmod -R 0775 bootstrap storage vendor
```

Finally, go to: `http://localhost:8000` to see your app online

### Great vscode extension

We recomend use of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client) extension.

## Git flow

To file a new a feature

- create a branch from `master` branch. Use the pattern: `feature/description`
- file a pull request on `master` branch
- since your PR is aproved, it will be merged to `master` branch
- in a moment in time we'll create a release, using the pattern: `release/vX.X.X`
